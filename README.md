AWS Serverless Project Series

As I have been wanting to focus on backend, I have built 7 practical projects, each building upon the last one.

## The Projects

| 1   | combination API    | ✅     | [combinationAPI](https://github.com/joan-gerard/combinationAPI_AWS_Serverless)| In the Lamba, we have business logic to query two different API endpoints (PC game deals API + currency converter API) and combine the data. The final endpoint allows users to find game deals and convert price to their chosen currency.         |
