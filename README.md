AWS Serverless Project Series

As I have been wanting to focus on backend, I have built 7 practical projects, each building upon the last one.

## The Projects

| Projects           | Repos                            | Description                                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| combination API    | [combinationAPI](https://github.com/joan-gerard/combinationAPI_AWS_Serverless)| In the Lamba, we have business logic to query two different API endpoints (PC game deals API + currency converter API) and combine the data. The final endpoint allows users to find game deals and convert price to their chosen currency.         |
